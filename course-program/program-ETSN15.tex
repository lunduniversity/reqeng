\noindent 
The objective of the course is to give basic and advanced knowledge and skills within requirements engineering for large-scale development of systems completely or partly based on software. The course gives both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in methods and techniques for requirements engineering. The course gives training in scientific paper reading.

\section{Learning Objectives}
\subsection{Knowledge and understanding}
For a passing grade the student must
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item be able to define basic concepts and principles within requirements engineering 
\item give an account of several different types of requirements
\item be able to describe and value several different methods and techniques for requirements engineering
\item be able to describe and relate different sub-processes within requirements engineering
\item be able to describe the relation between the requirements engineering process and other processes in the product lifecycle
\item be able to describe the relation between requirements engineering and market-driven product management
\item be able to discuss some scientific results within requirements engineering research
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Skills and abilities}
For a passing grade the student must
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item be able to choose suitable requirements techniques for a given context
\item     be able to apply several different techniques for requirements elicitation
\item     be able to apply several different techniques for requirements specification
\item     be able to apply several different techniques for requirements validation
\item     be able to apply several different techniques for requirements prioritisation
\end{enumerate}
  The release plan defines which requirements that are implemented by the project group as mock-up designs in release R3, and which requirements are selected to be fully implemented in the imagined releases R4 and R5. 
\subsection{Judgement and approach}
For a passing grade the student must
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item     be able to consciously select a process depending on the nature of the requirements
\item     show a systematic and long-term approach to processes
\item     be able to consciously see the problem in the relation between the quality of requirements and the quality of the resulting implementation
\item     be able to adequately involve users in the requirements engineering process
\item     be able to consciously see the problem in the relation between requirements engineering and economical aspects of product development
\end{enumerate}

\section{Contents}
The course includes theory and practice regarding the following topics:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Requirements on different abstraction levels and in different contexts

\item Sub-processes of requirements engineering and their relation

\item Specification of data requirements, e.g. using virtual windows and data models

\item Specification of functional requirements, e.g. using textual feature requirements and task descriptions

\item Specification of different types of non-functional requirements, e.g. usability, performance, reliability

\item Different techniques for requirements elicitation

\item Different techniques for requirements validation

\item Different techniques for requirements prioritization

\item Market-driven requirements engineering and product management
\end{enumerate}

\section{Course Elements}
\begin{description}
\item[L: Lectures] The lectures provide an overview of the literature. They do not cover every detail, but give a high-level structure of the subject and thereby aid self-studies of the literature. Discussions are promoted.
\item[E: Exercises] The main objective of the exercises is to support the project and prepare for the written exam through prototypical problems, by connecting theory to practice and to give opportunity to discuss details of RE techniques.
\item[Lab: Computer lab sessions] The lab sessions illustrate computer supported
prioritization and release planning, and demonstrates the complexity of requirements selection and scheduling. Preparations are mandatory. %
\item[P: Project] The project involves performing practical requirements engineering for a given case, and is carried out in groups of 6-8 students. The project involves a number of deliverables and a final project conference where the learning outcome of each project is presented. Project groups are established during the first course week.

\end{description}




\section{Assessment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project is graded fail | 3 | 4 | 5 based on project deliverables.
\item Approved lab session preparations and assignments are required for passing.
\item The written exam has two parts: 
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep,noitemsep]
  \item Part A: Multiple-choice questions where at least 75\% (preliminary limit) must be correct for passing, and 
  \item Part B: Written assignments with a total of 100 points of which at least 50p (preliminary limit) is required for passing the exam. Part B is marked only if Part A is passed.

\end{itemize}
\item The final course grade on the scale fail | 3 | 4 | 5 is based on the written exam points from Part B and the project grade using the following mapping: 

\vspace{1em}

\begin{tabular}{r | c c c}
 & Project: 3 & Project: 4 & Project: 5 \\
\hline
 & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Exam points Part B}    \\
Final: 3 & $ \geq 50$ & $\geq 50$ & $\geq 50$ \\
Final: 4 & $ \geq 75$ & $\geq 67$ & $\geq 60$ \\
Final: 5 & $ \geq 90$ & $\geq 83$ & $\geq 75$ \\
\hline
